### Code to simulate the Central Limit Theorem

The central limit theorem states that: Given a dataset with unknown distribution (it could be uniform, binomial or completely random), the sample means will approximate the normal distribution.

Install requirements using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run code using:
```
python central_limit_theorem.py
```

To try out different values of sample size modify the `sample_size_list`.

To try out different values of sample count modify the `sample_count_list`.
